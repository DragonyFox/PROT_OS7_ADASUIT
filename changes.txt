using Arduino Nano Every because of RAM usage
removed RGB inputs -> controlled over DIN, color stored for each individual coordinate
There's only DIN, 5V and GRND on WS2812B's
fillscreen low -> 0 (sets color value of RGB to 0 each)
matrix.write -> matrix.show
matrix.Color() -> removed, set variables for happycolor etc. to pass on when using drawBitmap()
serial.begin(9600) -> matrix.begin()
draw.Bitmap -> replace HIGH/LOW with desired color
